- given $\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{h(x)}{g(x)}$. 
	- prove that $f(x)$ defined on $(0,\infty)$.
		- show that $g(x)$ differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ and especially in $[0,\infty)$
		- if $g(0)=0$ we need to show that $g$ is increasing
			- (WAY 1 - by q8.29) show that $g'(x)\geq 0$ and there is no subinterval on which $g'(x)=0$ for all $x$ in it. therefore $g$ is increasing and $f$ is defined.
			- (WAY 2 by 8.18) $g'(x)>0\implies$ $g$ is **increasing** (on $(0,\infty)$)
	- prove that $f$ attains maximum on $(0,\infty)$

- prove that for $0<a<b$ and for all $n>1$ we have $$na^{n-1}(b-a)<b^n-a^n<na^{n-1}(b-a)$$

# 4b - Inequalities

- prove that $\arcsin x>x+\frac{x^3}{6}$ for all $0<x<1$
	- we need to prove that $f(x)=\arcsin x-x-\frac{x^3}{6}>0$
	- $f'(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-x^2 }}-1-\frac{x^2}{2}$
