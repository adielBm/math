| Compound Interest |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Simple interest (for one year) | $A=P(1+r)$ |
| Interest compounded $n$ times per year | $A(t)=P\left( 1+\frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}$ |
| Interest compounded continuously | $A(t)=Pe^{rt}=\displaystyle\lim_{ n \to \infty }P\left( 1+\frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}$ |

- $A(t)$ is the amount of money after $t$ years
- $P$ is the initial investment
- $r$ is the annual interest rate
- $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year
- $t$ is the time in years
