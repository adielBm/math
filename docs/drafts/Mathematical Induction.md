- First Principle of Mathematical Induction 
	- Let $S$ be a set of integers containing $a$. Suppose $S$ has the property that whenever some integer $n â‰¥ a$ belongs to $S$, then the integer $n + 1$ also belongs to $S$. Then, $S$ contains every integer greater than or equal to $a$.
- Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
	- Let $S$ be a set of integers containing $a$. Suppose $S$ has the property that $n$ belongs to S whenever every integer less than $n$ and greater than or equal to a belongs to $S$. Then, $S$ contains every integer greater than or equal to $a$.
