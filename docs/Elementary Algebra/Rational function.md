- A function $f$ is called a **rational function** if it can be written in the form $\displaystyle  f(x)={\frac {P(x)}{Q(x)}}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomial functions of $x$ and $Q$ is not the zero function.
	- $\text{dom}(f)=\{ x \mid Q(x)\neq 0 \}$
	- A rational function is **proper** if $\deg P<\deg Q$, otherwise it is **improper**.
