- A **quadratic equation** is an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ (where $a\neq 0$)
- Its solutions are given by the **quadratic formula** $\displaystyle x=\frac{-b \pm\sqrt{ b^2-4ac }}{2a}$
- The **discriminant** of this quadratic equation is $D=b^2-4ac$
	1. If $D > 0$, then the equation has two distinct real solutions.
	2. If $D = 0$, then the equation has exactly one real solution.
	3. If $D < 0$, then the equation has no real solution.
