- **Distance Formula** - The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $d=\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$
- **Midpoint Formula** - The midpoint $M$ of the line segment joining the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\displaystyle M=(\frac{{x_{1}+x_{2}}}{2},\frac{{y_{1}+y_{2}}}{2})$
## Equation of a line

> $m$ is the slope of the line

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Two-point form | $\displaystyle  y-y_{1}={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}(x-x_{1})$ | $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are any two points of the line, (if $x_{1}\neq x_{2}$ then $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\tan(\theta)$ is the slope) |
| Slope–intercept form (y) | $y=mx+y_{0}$ | assuming non-vertical line. $y_{0}$ is y-intercept |
| Slope–intercept form (x) | $y=m(x-x_{0})$ | assuming non-horizontal line. $x_{0}$ is x-intercept |
| Standard Form | $Ax+By=C$ |  |
| Point–slope form | $y=m(x-x_{0})+y_{0}$ | $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ is any point of the line. (assuming non-vertical line) |
| Intercept form | $\displaystyle{\frac {x}{x_{0}}}+{\frac {y}{y_{0}}}=1$ | assuming the line is not parallel to an axis and does not pass through the origin. The intercept values $x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$ are nonzero |


- **Angle Between Two Lines** - If two nonperpendicular lines have slopes $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, then the tangent of the angle between the two lines is $\tan \theta={|{\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m_{2}}}|}$

- If two nonvertical lines are parallel, then their slopes are equal.
	- Alternative Form: $\ell_{1}\parallel \ell_{2}\iff m_{1}=m_{2}$
- If two lines (neither horizontal nor vertical) are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is $-1$. 
	- Alternative Form: $\ell_{1}\perp \ell_{2}\iff m_{1}m_{2}=-1$ where neither $\ell_{1}$ nor $\ell_{2}$ is a vertical line or a horizontal line.
