- **Proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both
- **Statement** is what typically asserted by a declarative sentence, but not the sentence itself. Every statement must be either true or false, although the truth or falsity of a given statement may be unknown.



- An **argument** is a set of propositions of which one, the conclusion, is claimed to be supported by the others, the premises.


- **deductive argument**
	- A deductive argument is said to be **valid** if the truthfulness of the premises necessitates that the conclusion be true, otherwise is said to be **invalid**
		- Validity and invalidity are attributes of deductive arguments, while truth and falsity apply to individual propositions.
		- Validity depends on the logical relation between premises and conclusion, while truth relates to propositions corresponding to reality.
		- Validity does not apply to a single proposition; the necessary relation cannot exist within one proposition.
		- Argument can be valid even if one or more premises are false.
	- A deductive argument is said to be **sound** if is valid and all of its premises are true (and as a consequence its conclusion is true as well)
