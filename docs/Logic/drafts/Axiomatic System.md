- An **axiomatic system** is any set of axioms from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to logically derive theorems
	- An axiomatic system is said to be **consistent** if it lacks contradiction. 
	- A system is called **independent** if each of its underlying axioms is independent.
		- In an axiomatic system, an **axiom** is called **independent** if it cannot be proven or disproven from other axioms in the system.
	- An axiomatic system is called **complete** if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable from the system's axioms (equivalently, every statement is capable of being proven true or false)
	- An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called **categorical** (The property of categoriality ensures the completeness of a system, however the converse is not true)
- A **theory** is a consistent, relatively-self-contained body of knowledge which usually contains an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems.
- A **model** for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set, which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. 
	- Two models are said to be **isomorphic** if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship

- A set of axioms is said to be **consistent** if there is no statement $A$ such that both $A$ and its negation are provable from the set of axioms. 
	- Informally, a collection of axioms is consistent if there is a model for the axioms; the axioms of group theory are consistent as $G = {e}$, where $·$ is defined on $G$ by $e · e = e$, is a model of these axioms.

- A consistent theory T in a language L is categorical if all models of T are isomorphic.



- A theory is categorical if it has exactly one model (up to isomorphism)
	- In first-order logic, only theories with a finite model can be categorical. 
	- Higher-order logic contains categorical theories with an infinite model. 
		- For example, the second-order Peano axioms are categorical, having a unique model whose domain is the set of natural numbers
