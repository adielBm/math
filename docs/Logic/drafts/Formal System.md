- A **rule of inference** is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions).

# Formal System

- **Formal System**
	- A **formal system** is an abstract structure or formalization of an *axiomatic system* used for inferring theorems from axioms by a set of inference rules.
	- A **formal system** consists of a formal language together with a deductive system
	- A **formal system** is a formal language $L$ together with a deductive system for $L$
	- A **formal system** is $(D, R)$ where D is a set of data structures, and R is a set of rules which determine which transitions between objects in D are allowed.
	- A **formal system** is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics
	- A **formal system** $S=(K,P,V)$ consists of three finite and disjoint sets of symbols $K,P,V$ and two additional separate symbols $⇒$ for "implication" and , a comma for punctuation. 
		- K is the set of target symbols, 
		- P is the set of predicate symbols, 
		- and V is the set of variables. 
		- A formal system will usually have associated with it a finite set of strings of symbols from $K∪P∪V∪{,⇒}$ . Strings in this set are called axioms.


### Properties 

- A formal system is **sound** if and only if every well-formed formula that can be proven in the system is logically valid with respect to the logical semantics of the system.
- A formal system is **recursive** (i.e. effective) or **recursively enumerable** if the set of axioms and the set of inference rules are decidable sets or semidecidable sets, respectively.


> Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems


## Examples 

- A predicate calculus is a formal system consisting of a first order language, the set of all well-formed formulas, a particular set � of well-formed formulas, which are called logical axioms, and a list of rules of deduction. 

# Deductive system

- aka: deductive system, deductive apparatus, proof system

- A **deductive system**, consists of: 
	- the axioms (or axiom schemata)
	- rules of inference, that can be used to derive theorems of the system.
- The **deductive system** may consist of a set of transformation rules, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of axioms, or have both.
- **Deductive system**, which has rules of inference that take axioms and infers theorems, both of which are part of the formal language.

- A **deductive system** for a formal language $\mathcal{L}$ is a formally specified system for deriving conclusions about the well-formed formulas of $\mathcal{L}$

- An example of deductive system is first order logic.
