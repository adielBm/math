- A **proof system** includes the components
	- Formal language: The set L of formulas admitted by the system, for example, propositional logic or first-order logic.
	- Rules of inference: List of rules that can be employed to prove theorems from axioms and theorems.
	- Axioms: Formulas in L assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms.
- Let L be a formal language. A **proof system** P for L comprises: Axioms and/or axiom schemata; Rules of inference for deriving theorems.
	- Also known as: axiom system, mathematical theory
- Formal Proof
- **formation rules** are rules for describing which strings of symbols formed from the alphabet of a formal language are syntactically valid within the language.


- A proof system is **complete** if every valid formula is provable
- A proof system is **sound** if every provable formula is valid
