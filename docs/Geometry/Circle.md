- A **circle** is the locus of points in a plane that are at a fixed distance from a given point.
- Circumference
- Central angle
- Arc
- Chord
- Diameters
- Inscribed Angle 
- **incircle** or **inscribed circle** (מעגל חסום)
- Circumscribed circle (or circumcircle) (מעגל חוסם)
- A **locus** is the set of all points and only those points that satisfy a given condition (or set of conditions)

- A **segment** of a circle is a region bounded by a chord and its minor (or major) arc.

- Area of a circle $\pi r^2$
- The circumference $2\pi r=\pi d$

- Arc
	- Arc Length $s=r\theta$
- Chord 
	- Every chord in the circle is inside the circle.
	- The longest chords in a circle are the diameters.
	- Let $AB$ and $A'B'$ be two chords in the circle. Then $\overline{AB} = \overline{A'B'}$ if and only if $\angle AOB = \angle A'OB'$

- Inscribed Angle
	- **Inscribed angle theorem** - An **angle $θ$ inscribed** in a circle is half of the central angle $2θ$ that subtends the same arc on the circle. Therefore, the angle does not change as its vertex is moved to different positions on the circle.
		- **Thales's theorem** if $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct points on a circle where the line $AC$ is a diameter, the angle $∠ ABC$ is a right angle.
	- The sum of two inscribed angle subtends on the same chord on both sides is $180^\circ$

- A straight line and a circle intersect in at most two points.
- A tangent to the circle is perpendicular to the radius to the tangent point


- A tangent to the circle is a straight line passing through a point on a circle, and perpendicular to the radius to this point, is a tangent to the circle


- Every triangle have a unique circumcircle
- circumcenter of triangle is the point where three perpendicular bisectors from the sides of a triangle intersect or meet
- A square can be circumscribed in a circle if and only if the sum of each pair of opposite angles in it is $180^\circ$.
- Inside each triangle has a unique circumscribed circle
- The center of the circumscribed circle is the point of intersection of the triangle's perpendicular bisectors.
- The Locus of points in triangle $\triangle ABC$ that are equidistant from sides $AB$ and $AC$ is the bisector of the angle $\angle BAC$.
- Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose area is $S$, perimeter is $k$, and the radius of the inscribed circle is $r$. The following exists: $S = \frac{k \cdot r}{2}$


- A **sector** of a circle is a region bounded by two radii of the circle and an arc intercepted by those radii.
	- Area of a Sector of Circle $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2$
