- This repo is a fork of [jackyzha0/quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) with some style changes i made.
- My math notes, (markdown using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)), are located in the `math` folder. (see `math/index.md` for more details)
- Currently hosted at [adiel.netlify.app](https://adiel.netlify.app/). (Build command: `npx quartz build -d math`, Publish directory: `public`)

Suggestions are very welcome! thanks
