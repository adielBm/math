# Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation


$$\displaystyle  F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}$$

- $F$ is the force between two bodies
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
- $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are the masses of the two bodies
- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two bodies

- Gravitational constant ${G=6.6743\cdot10^{âˆ’11}}{\mathsf{  kg^{-1}m^{3}s^{-2}}}$ 
	- (Dimensional Formula: ${\mathsf {M^{-1}L^{3}T^{-2}}}$)
