- $W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}=Fd\cos(\theta)$ 
    - $W$ is the work done by the force $\vec{F}$ over the distance $\vec{d}$
    - $\vec{F}$ is the force vector acting on the object
    - $\vec{d}$ is the distance vector
    - $F$ and $d$ are their magnitudes
    - $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the distance vector
    - Work is the [[Vectors#Dot Product|dot product]] of the force and distance vectors

- $W=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) dx$ (Work = Integral of Force with respect to distance)
    - $F(x)$ is the force acting on the object as a function of distance $x$
    - $dx$ is an infinitesimally small distance.
    - $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the initial and final positions of the object, respectively.
    - $W$ is the work done by the force $F(x)$ over the distance $x_1$ to $x_2$.
