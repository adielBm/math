## Dalton’s Atomic Theory

1. Each element is made up of indivisible and indestructible atoms.
2. All atoms of a given element carry the same properties.
3. Atoms combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds.
4. A chemical reaction changes the way atoms are bound together. In other words, a chemical reaction is simply a rearrangement of atoms.

#todo  ^ or this

1. Elements consist of indivisible small particles (atoms).
2. All atoms of the same element are identical; different elements have different types of atom.
3. Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed
4. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements join insimpleratios to form molecules.

___

	- $k$ represents Coulomb's constant.
	- $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ represent the charges of the two particles.
	- $r$ represents the distance between the nuclei of the two particles.
