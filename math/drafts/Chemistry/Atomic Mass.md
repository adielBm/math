- **atomic number** (Z) is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is also the number of electrons in a neutral atom.
- **neutron number** (N) is the number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.
- **atomic mass** ($m$ or $m_{\text{a}}$) is the mass of an atom (expressed in unified atomic mass units (u) or kilogram (kg))
    - (mass of proton) $m_{\text{p}} \approx 1.007 276 466 5789 \, \text{u}$
    - (mass of neutron) $m_{\text{n}} \approx 1.008 664 916 06 \, \text{u}$
    - (mass of electron) $m_{\text{e}} \approx 5.485 799 090 441 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{u}$
- **unified atomic mass unit** (u) or **dalton** (Da) is a non-SI unit of mass defined as $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest.
    - The **atomic mass constant** is a constant defined as $m_{u} =\frac{1}{12} m(^{12}\text{C}) = 1 \, \text{u} = 1.66053906892(52) \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$
- **(atomic) mass number** (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. (A = Z + N)
    - It is approximately equal to the atomic mass of the atom in unified atomic mass units.
- **relative atomic mass** ($A_r$) is a dimensionless quantity defined as $A_r=\sum_i \left( m_i \cdot f_i \right)$, where $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$-th isotope of the element and $f_i$ is the fractional abundance of the $i$-th isotope.
    - (aka: **atomic weight** or **average atomic mass**)
- **amount of substance** (n) is the number of entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) in a sample of matter
- **mole** (mol) is SI unit of amount of substance
    - The **Avogadro number** is $N_0=6.02214076×10^{23}$ which is the number of entities in one mole of a substance
    - The **Avogadro constant** $N_\text{A}=6.02214076×10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}$ 
    - Approximatlly one mole based on the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12
- **molar mass** ($M$) is the mass of one mole of a substance (expressed in g/mol)
    - $M=\frac{m}{N_A}$ where $m$ is the mass of the substance in grams and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number

- $n=\frac{N}{N_A}=\frac{m}{M}$
    - $n$ is the number of moles of a substance
    - $N$ is the number of particles of a substance
    - $m$ is the mass of the substance (in grams)
    - $M$ is the molar mass of the substance (in g/mol)
    - $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant (in mol$^{-1}$)
