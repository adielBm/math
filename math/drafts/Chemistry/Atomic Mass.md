- An **atomic number** (Z) is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is also the number of electrons in a neutral atom.
- A **neutron number** (N) is the number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.
- An **atomic mass** ($m$ or $m_{\text{a}}$) is the mass of an atom (expressed in unified atomic mass units (u) or kilogram (kg))
    - (mass of proton) $m_{\text{p}} \approx 1.007 276 466 5789 \, \text{u}$
    - (mass of neutron) $m_{\text{n}} \approx 1.008 664 916 06 \, \text{u}$
    - (mass of electron) $m_{\text{e}} \approx 5.485 799 090 441 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{u}$
    - Atomic mass is sometimes called **atomic weight** or **standard atomic weight**.
- An **unified atomic mass unit** (u) or **dalton** (Da) is a non-SI unit of mass defined as $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest.
    - The **atomic mass constant** is a constant defined as $m_{u} =\frac{1}{12} m(^{12}\text{C}) = 1 \, \text{u} = 1.66053906892(52) \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$
- The **atomic nucleus** of an atom is the small, dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of the atom.
- The **(atomic) mass number** (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons (together known as nucleons) in an atomic nucleus. (A = Z + N)
    - It is approximatelly equal to the atomic mass of the atom in unified atomic mass units.
- Notaion:
    - **Nuclear Symbol Notation**: $^{A}_{Z}\ce{X}$
        - $A$ is the mass number
        - $Z$ is the atomic number (optional if the element is known)
        - $\ce{X}$ is the chemical symbol of the element
        - Examples: 
            - (carbon-14) $\ce{^{14}_{6}C}$ or $\ce{^{14}C}$
            - (neon-20) $\ce{^{20}_{10}Ne}$ or $\ce{^{20}Ne}$
    - **Hyphen Notation**: $\ce{X}\text{-}A$
        - $A$ is the mass number
        - $\ce{X}$ is the chemical symbol or name of the element
        - Examples:
            - (carbon-14) $\ce{C-14}$ or $\ce{carbon-14}$
            - (neon-20) $\ce{Ne-20}$ or $\ce{neon-20}$
- Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called **isotopes**.
- The **natural abundance** (NA) of an isotope is the percentage of that isotope that occurs in nature.
- The **relative isotopic mass** of a particular isotope of an element is the mass the isotope relative to the mass of carbon-12.
    - It defined as $m_i = \frac{m}{m_{\text{C}}}$, where:
        - $m_i$ is the relative isotopic mass of the isotope (dimensionless)
        - $m$ is the mass of the isotope (in $\text{u}$)
        - $m_{\text{C}}$ is the mass of carbon-12 (in $\text{u}$)
- The **relative atomic mass** ($A_r$) of an element is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of the element.  
    - It defined as $A_r=\sum_i \left( m_i \cdot f_i \right)$, where: 
        - $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$-th isotope of the element (in $\text{u}$)
        - $f_i$ is the fractional abundance of the $i$-th isotope
    - (aka: **atomic weight** or **average atomic mass**)
- The **standard atomic weight** ($A_r^\circ(E)$ for an element $E$) is the weighted arithmetic mean #todo
- The **amount of substance** (n) of a sample of matter is the number of entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) in the sample.
- **mole** (mol) is SI unit of amount of substance
    - The **Avogadro number** is $N_0=6.02214076×10^{23}$ which is the number of entities in one mole of a substance
    - The **Avogadro constant** $N_\text{A}=6.02214076×10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}$ 
    - Approximatlly one mole is based on the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12
- **molar mass** ($M$) is the mass of one mole of a substance (expressed in g/mol)
    - $M=\frac{m}{N_A}$  
        - $m$ is the mass of the substance in grams 
        - $N_A$ is Avogadro's number
    - $M=\sum_i \left( n_i \cdot m_i \right)$ is the molar mass of a compound, where:
        - $M$ is the molar mass of the compound (in $\mathsf{g/mol}$)
        - $n_i$ is the number of atoms of element $i$ in one molecule of the compound
        - $m_i$ is the atomic mass of element $i$
    - $n=\frac{N}{N_A}=\frac{m}{M}$
        - $n$ is the number of moles of a substance
        - $N$ is the number of particles of a substance
