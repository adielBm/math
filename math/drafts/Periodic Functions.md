- A function $F(t)$ is said to be **periodic** if there exists a nonzero number $T$ such that $F(t+T)=F(t)$ for all $t$ in the domain of $F$.
	- A nonzero constant $T$ for which this is the case is called a **period** of the function
	- The smallest such $T$ (if it exists) is called the **fundamental period** (or **the period**) of the function
- If $F(t)$ is periodic with period $T$, then: 
	- $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, F(t+nT)=F(t)$
	- The function $G(t)=F(at)$ is periodic with period $\frac{T}{a}$ (for any nonzero constant $a$)
	- The **amplitude** of $F$ is $A=\frac{1}{2}(\text{max}(F)-\text{min}(F))$ 
	- When $F$ is a function of time $t$, then:
		- The **period** $T$ is the time it takes to complete one full cycle
		- The **frequency** of $F$ is $f=\frac{1}{T}$ (in $\mathsf{s^{-1}}= \mathsf{Hz}$)
		- The **angular frequency** of $F$ is $\omega=2\pi f$ (in $\mathsf{rad\cdot s^{-1}}$)
