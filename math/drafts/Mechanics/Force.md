# Newton's laws of motion


1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
2. 

## Newton's Second Law

$$F=ma$$

- 

# Newton's law of universal gravitation


$$\displaystyle  F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}$$

- $F$ is the force between two bodies
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
- $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are the masses of the two bodies
- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two bodies

- Gravitational constant ${G=6.6743\cdot10^{âˆ’11}}{\mathsf{  kg^{-1}m^{3}s^{-2}}}$ 
	- (Dimensional Formula: ${\mathsf {M^{-1}L^{3}T^{-2}}}$)



# Harmonic Motion

#### Hook's law

$$\mathbf {F} =-k\mathbf {x}$$

- $\mathbf{F}$ is the restoring elastic force exerted by the spring (in $\mathsf{N}$)
- $k$ is the spring constatnt (in $\mathsf{N\cdot m^{-1}}$)
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position (in $\mathsf{m}$)


#### Periods

- $f=T^{-1}$
	- $f$ is the frequency (in $\mathsf{s^{-1}}$)
	- $T$ is the period - the time it takes to complete one full cycle (in $\mathsf{s}$)
- Pendulum Period: $\displaystyle T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{L}{g} }$
	- $L$ is the length of the pendulum
	- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity
- Spring Period: $\displaystyle T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k}}$
	- $m$ is the mass of the object (in $\mathsf{kg}$)
	- $k$ is the spring constatnt (in $\mathsf{N\cdot m^{-1}}$)
