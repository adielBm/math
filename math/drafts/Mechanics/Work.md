- $W = F \cdot d$ (Work = Force x Distance) 
    - $F$ is the force acting on the object. (in Newtons (N))
    - $d$ is the distance the object moves. (in meters (m))
    - $W$ is the work done by the force $F$ over the distance $d$. (in Joules (J))

- $W=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) dx$ (Work = Integral of Force with respect to distance)
    - $F(x)$ is the force acting on the object as a function of distance $x$
    - $dx$ is an infinitesimally small distance.
    - $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the initial and final positions of the object, respectively.
    - $W$ is the work done by the force $F(x)$ over the distance $x_1$ to $x_2$.
