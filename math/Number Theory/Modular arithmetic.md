- Given an integer $n > 1$, called a **modulus**, two integers $a$ and $b$ are said to be **congruent modulo** $n$, if $n$ is a divisor of their difference; that is, if there is an integer $k$ such that $a âˆ’ b = kn$
	- Congruence modulo $n$ is denoted $a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}$
	- Congruence modulo $n$ is a **congruence relation**, meaning that it is an [[Binary Relation#Equivalence relation|Equivalence relation]] that is compatible with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, translation, scaling and exponentiation
