I've noticed that hebrew frequently borrows terms from uk english rather than us English. here are some examples:

| heb translation | uk                | us           |
| :-------------- | :---------------- | :----------- |
| כדורגל          | football          | soccer       |
| מומנט (כח)      | moment (of force) | torque       |
| צ'יפס           | chips             | french fries |
| ביסקוויט        | biscuit           | cookie       |

Is there a general tendency for Hebrew to favor UK English loanwords, or are these just isolated instances? I would love to hear your thoughts and any additional examples!
