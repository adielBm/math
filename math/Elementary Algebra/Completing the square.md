Given any monic quadratic $x^2+bx+c=$. 

it is possible to form a square that has the same first two terms: $$\displaystyle x^{2}+bx+{\frac {b^{2}}{4}}=\left(x+{\frac {b}{2}}\right)^{2}$$his square differs from the original quadratic only in the value of the constant term. Therefore, we can write $$\displaystyle x^2+bx+c=\left( x+\frac{b}{2} \right)^2+\left( c-\frac{b^2}{4} \right)$$


- A **square number** (or **perfect square**) is an integer that is the square of an integer
