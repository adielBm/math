- Every proper [[rational function]] can be expressed as a sum $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=F_{1}(x)+F_{2}(x)+\dots+F_{n}(x)$ where $F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),\dots,F_{n}(x)$ are rational functions of the form $\frac{A}{(ax+b)^k}$ or $\frac{Ax+B}{(ax^2+bx+c)^k}$ in which the denominators are factors of $Q(x)$. 
	- The sum is called the **partial fraction decomposition** of $P(x)/Q(x)$, and the terms are called **partial fractions**



## Distinct Linear Factors

Suppose that we can factor $Q(x)$ as $$Q(x)=(a_{1}x+b_{1})(a_{2}x+b_{2})\cdots(a_{n}x+b_{n})$$ with no factor repeated.  In this case the partial fraction decomposition of $P(x)/Q(x)$ takes the form $$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}=\frac{A_{1}}{(a_{1}x+b_{1})}+\frac{A_{2}}{(a_{2}x+b_{2})}+\dots+\frac{A_{n}}{(a_{n}x+b_{n})}$$
## Repeated Linear Factors

Suppose the complete factorization of $Q(x)$ contains the linear factor $ax + b$
repeated $k$ times; that is, $(ax+b)^k$ is a factor of $Q(x)$. Then, corresponding to
each such factor, the partial fraction decomposition for $P(x)/Q(x)$ contains $$\frac{A_{1}}{ax+b}+\frac{A_{2}}{(ax+b)^2}+\dots+\frac{A_{k}}{(ax+b)^k}$$
