- A **line segment** is the part of a line that consists of two points, known as endpoints, and all points between them.
	- The **midpoint** of a line segment is the point that separates the line segment into two congruent parts.
		- The midpoint of a line segment is unique
	- **Congruent ($\cong$) line segments** are two line segments that have the same length.


- The **distance** between two points $A$ and $B$ is the length of the line segment $\overline {AB}$ that joins the two points.
- **Ray** $AB$, denoted by $\overrightarrow{AB}$ , is the union of $\overline{AB}$ and all points $X$ on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ such that $B$ is between $A$ and $X$.
- **Parallel lines** $\parallel$ are lines that lie in the same plane but do not intersect.
- **Perpendicular lines** $\perp$ are two lines that meet to form congruent adjacent angles.
	- If two lines are perpendicular, then they meet to form right angles.
- A number of lines are **concurrent** if they have exactly one point in common.


- Through two distinct points, there is exactly one line.
- **Ruler Postulate** - The measure of any line segment is a unique positive number
- **Segment-Addition Postulate** - If $X$ is a point on $\overline{AB}$ and A-X-B, then $AX + XB + AB$.
- If two distinct lines intersect, they intersect at a point.
- Through three noncollinear points, there is exactly one plane


- Axiom 1 - Given a pair of straight lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, there are three possibilities:
	- The lines converge: $\ell_2 = \ell_1$.
	- The lines are parallel: $\ell_2 \parallel \ell_1$.
	- The lines intersect at exactly one point.

- Axiom 3 - Given a line $\ell$ and a point $A$ that is not on the line, there exists $m$ unique line passing through the point $A$ and parallel to the straight line


- $(\ell_{1}\parallel \ell_{3})\land(\ell_{2}\parallel \ell_{3})\implies{(\ell_{1}\parallel \ell_{2})}\lor{\ell_{1}= \ell_{2}}$

- Given two parallel lines $\ell_2 \parallel \ell_1$, any straight line intersected with $\ell_1$ also cuts $\ell_2$.


- Let $\ell_{1}$ be straight and let $P$ be a point. Then there is a single straight line passing through $P$ and perpendicular to $\ell$.
