- An **angle** is the union of two rays that share a common endpoint
- The **bisector of an angle** is the ray that separates the given angle into two congruent angles.
	- There is one and only one bisector for a given angle.



- **Protractor Postulate** - The measure of an angle is a unique positive number



## Angle Classification

- Acute angle
- Right angle
- Obtuse angle
- Straight angle
- Reflex angle


## Angle Relationships

- Complementary angles are two angles with a sum of $90^\circ$
- Supplementary angles are two angles with a sum of $180^\circ$
- Two angles are **adjacent** if they have a common vertex and a common side between them.
- **Congruent angles** are two angles with the same measure

### Intersection of Two Lines

- **Vertical angles** are the pair of congruent and opposing (non-adjacent) angles formed at the intersection of two lines. 
	- Vertical angles are equal to each other

### Line Intersects Two Lines

- **Corresponding angles** are angles which occupy the same relative position at each intersection where a straight line crosses two others. If the two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal.
	- Corresponding angles formed between two parallel lines are equal to each other.
- **Alternate angles** are two angles, not adjoining one another, that are formed on opposite sides of a line that intersects two other lines. If the original two lines are parallel, the alternate angles are equal.
	- Alternate angles formed between two parallel lines are equal to each other.
- The sum of two same-sided angles between parallel lines is $180^\circ$.
- If there is equality of corresponding angles or alternate angles, or sum of two same-sided angles between the lines is $180^\circ$ then $\ell_2 \parallel \ell_1$ or $\ell_{1}=\ell_{2}$
