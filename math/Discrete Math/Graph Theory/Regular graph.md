A regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors; i.e. every vertex has the same degree. regular graph with vertices of degree $k$ is called a $k$‑regular graph or regular graph of degree $k$. 

- from the [[Handshaking lemma]], a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.
- Regular [[Bipartite graph]] has a [[Edge Covering & Matching#Perfect matching|Perfect matching]]. ^[C3.Q2a]
- number of edges in $k$‑regular graph with $n$ vertices is $\frac{nk}{2}$
- (question 5) - let $G=(V,E)$ regular graph. if $|V|$ is odd, then $G$ or $\overline{G}$  is Eulerian graph
