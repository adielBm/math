Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that **visits each vertex exactly once**. A **Hamiltonian cycle** (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once.

A graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle is called a **Hamiltonian graph**.

- **Ore's Theorem** (3.2) - A simple graph with $n$ vertices ($n\geq 3$) is **Hamiltonian** if, for every pair of non-adjacent vertices, the sum of their degrees is $n$ or greater.
- **Dirac's Theorem** (3.3) - A simple graph with $n\geq 3$ vertices is **Hamiltonian** if every vertex has degree $\frac{n}{2}$ or greater. 
- Question (3.6) - A simple graph with $n\geq 3$ vertices, and $n$ is **odd**, and every vertex has degree $\frac{n}{2}-1$ at least, then it contains **Hamiltonian path**.
- Question (3.7) - $K_{a,b}$ [[Bipartite graph|complete bipartite]] graph is contain Hamiltonian cycle, if and only if, $a=b$ and $a,b\geq{2}$.
