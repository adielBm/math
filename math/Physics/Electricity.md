# Electric charge

- Electric charge is **quantized**, that is, exists in discrete quantities which are integer multiples of the **elementary charge** $e=1.6022\times 10 ^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}\approx 1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}$
	- The charge of an electron is $-e$ and the charge of a proton is $+e$
	- The SI unit of charge is the **coulomb** (C)
- **Conservation of charge**: the total charge in an isolated system remains constant
- An object can become charged by:
	- rubbing (friction)
	- conduction (transfer of charge from one charged object to another by touching)
	- induction

- $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$ is an uniform electric field, 
- $q$ is a tiny positive charge first placed at point $a$ near the positive plate and then released from rest and accelerates toward the negative plate. 
	- $W = Fd = qEd$ is the work done by the electric field $E$ to move a charge $q$ a distance $d$
	- $\Delta \mathrm{PE}=\mathrm{PE}_b-\mathrm{PE}_a=-W$ is the change in electric potential energy when a charge $q$ moves from point $a$ to point $b$
- $W_{\text{ext}}=Q_2 V=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r}$ is the work done by an external force to move a charge $Q_2$ from infinity to a distance $r$ from a charge $Q_1$

## Electric energy

- Electric energy is the capacity to do work
- $\displaystyle E=\int _{t_0} ^t Pdt=\int _{t_0} ^t VI dt$
    - $E$ is electrical energy (in joules) absorbed or supplied by an element from time $t_0$ to time $t$
    - $P$ is power (in watts)

	- $\displaystyle V = V_a - V_b = \frac{\mathrm{PE}_a-\mathrm{PE}_b}{q}$ is the **voltage** between points $a$ and $b$.
		- $V$ is the work done in moving unit charge from $b$ to $a$ (in $\mathsf{V}$)
		- $V_a$ and $V_b$ are the electric potentials at points $a$ and $b$ (in $\mathsf{V}$)
	- The SI unit of voltage is the **volt** (V), defined as $\mathsf{1\ V = 1\ J/C}$.
	- We often use ground (0 V) or infinity as a reference point.
	- Given a point $a$ with a higher potential $V_a$ and a point $b$ with a lower potential $V_b$:
		- A **negative charge** placed at $b$ has higher potential energy than at $a$, so it will move from $b$ to $a$ (when released) and decrease its potential energy.
			- $\mathrm{PE}_a < \mathrm{PE}_b \implies \Delta \mathrm{PE} < 0$
		- A **positive charge** placed at $a$ has higher potential energy than at $b$, so it will move from $a$ to $b$ (when released) and decrease its potential energy.
			- $\mathrm{PE}_a > \mathrm{PE}_b \implies \Delta \mathrm{PE} > 0$
		- In both cases, $\Delta V = V_a - V_b > 0$.

	- $V_{ba}$ is the potential difference between points $a$ and $b$ (in $\mathsf{V}$)

- The SI unit of current is the **ampere** (abbreviated $\mathsf{amp}$ or $\mathsf{A}$), defined as $\mathsf{1\ A = 1\ C/s}$
- A current is **positive** if it flows from the positive terminal of a voltage source to the negative terminal


- #todo 
	- **electric current** (aka: **conventional current**) is a flow of electric charge
		- The direction of conventional current is that of positive charge flow.
		- electric current from $+$ to $-$ is equivalent to a negative electron flow from $-$ to $+$
		- conventional current combines the effects of electron, ion, proton, and hole flows all into one number.
		- Positive conventional current always flows from a high potential to a low potential.
		- conventional current is not the opposite of electron current
		- Electron current is a subset of conventional current. 
	- A 19th-century convention, still in use, treats any electric current as a flow of positive charge from a region of positive potential to one of negative potential.
		- The real motion, however, in the case of electrons flowing through a metal conductor, is in the opposite direction, from negative to positive.

### Alternating Current

- $V=V_0\sin(\omega t)$ is the voltage of an alternating current (see [[Waves#Sine Wave|sine wave]])
	- $V_0$ is the **peak voltage** (in $\mathsf{V}$) (the _amplitude_)
	- $\omega=2\pi f$ is the angular frequency (in $\mathsf{rad/s}$) where $f$ is the frequency (in $\mathsf{Hz}$)

	- $I_0$ is the peak current (in $\mathsf{A}$)
- $P=I^2R=I_0^2R\sin^2(\omega t)$ is the power transformed in a resistance $R$ at time $t$
	- Because the current is squared, the power is always positive
	- The average power is $\overline{P}=\frac{1}{2}I_0^2R$
- The [[Means#Root-Mean Square (RMS)|rms]] values of sinusoidally alternating currents and voltages are:
	- $I_{\text{rms}}=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$
	- $V_{\text{rms}}=\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}$

- the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points
	- Ohm's Law holds for **ohmic materials** (like most metals) but not for **non-ohmic materials** (like diodes, transistors, and other semiconductors)
	- The unit of resistance is the $\mathsf{ohm}$ ($\mathsf{\Omega}$) defined as $\mathsf{1\ \Omega = 1\ V/A}$
	- The reciprocal of resistance is called the **electrical conductance** (in $\mathsf{S}$, siemens, which is $\mathsf{1\ S = 1 \Omega^{-1}}$)
	- $\displaystyle V=IR$
		- $V$ is the voltage (in $\mathsf{V}$)
		- $I$ is the current (in $\mathsf{A}$)
		- $R$ is the resistance (in $\mathsf{\Omega}$)
- Electrical **resistivity** (or **specific resistance**) denoted by $\rho$, is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current
	- $\displaystyle R=\rho\frac{L}{A}$
		- $R$ is the resistance of the conductor (in $\mathsf{\Omega}$)
		- $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material (in $\mathsf{\Omega\cdot m}$)
		- $L$ is the length of the conductor (in $\mathsf{m}$)
		- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the conductor (in $\mathsf{m^2}$)
	- The reciprocal of the resistivity, called the **electrical conductivity** (or **specific conductance**) is $\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}$ (in $\mathsf{S/m}$, siemens per meter, or $\mathsf{(\Omega\cdot m)^{-1}}$)

- The resistors could be simple resistors, or they could be lightbulbs, heating elements, or other resistive devices

#### Series Resistors

```tex
\usepackage{circuitikz}

\begin{circuitikz}[american, thick]
    \draw (0,0) to [battery1, l_={$V$}] (6,0) to (6,1)

    to [R, l_={$R_1$}] (0,1) 
    -- (0,0);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{document}
```

- When $n$ resistors are connected end to end along a single path they are said to be connected in **series**
	- $\displaystyle R_{\text{eq}}=R_1+R_2+\ldots+R_n$
	- Any charge that passes through $R_1$ will pass through $R_2$ and so on, hence the same current flows through each resistor in series
	- When we add resistors in series: 
		- the current through the circuit decreases (more resistors to pass through)
		- the net resistance increases (the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances)
	- If $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$ are the voltages across $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n$ (resp.) then $V=V_1+V_2+\ldots+V_n=I R_{\text{eq}}$ is the total voltage across the series

#### Parallel Resistors

```tex
\usepackage{circuitikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{circuitikz}[american, thick]
	\draw (-1,0) -- (2,0) to (-1,0) to [battery1, l_={$V$}] (-1,-2) -- (2,-2);
	\draw (0,0) to [R, l={$R_1$}, i={$I_1$}](0,-2);
	\draw (1,0) to [R, l={$R_2$}, i={$I_2$}](1,-2);
	\draw (2,0) to [R, l={$R_3$}, i={$I_3$}](2,-2);
	\draw (-1,0) to [short, i={$I$}] (0,0);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{document}
```

- We say that $n$ resistors are connected in **parallel** when the current from the source splits into $n$ paths
	- $\displaystyle I_1=\frac{V}{R_1}, \ldots, I_n=\frac{V}{R_n}$ are the currents through each resistor
	- $I=I_1+I_2+\ldots+I_n$ is the total current in the circuit
	- $\displaystyle I=\frac{V}{R_{\text{eq}}}$
	- $\implies\displaystyle \boxed{\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{R_n}}$
	- When we add resistors in parallel: 
		- the current in the circuit increases (more paths for the current to flow) 
		- the net (or _equivalent_) resistance decreases  
		- (example: a parallel circuit with two resistors of $4\ \mathsf{\Omega}$ has a total resistance of $\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$, so $R_{\text{eq}}=2\ \mathsf{\Omega}$)

> the _eq_ is short for _equivalent_, which means that the total resistance of the circuit is the same as the resistance of a single resistor that would replace the parallel resistors or series resistors

# Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws

- **Kirchhoff's (circuit) laws** (or **Kirchhoff's rules**) are two equalities that deal with the current and potential difference.

### Kirchhoffâs Current Law 

- aka: **first law**, **junction rule**	

- For any node in an electrical circuit, the algebraic sum of the currents flowing into and out of the node is zero. Mathematically $$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} I_i=0$$
	- $I_i$ is the current flowing through the $i$-th branch
	- $n$ is the total number of branches with currents flowing towards or away from the node
	- Currents flowing into the node are considered positive, and currents flowing out of the node are considered negative (or vice versa, depending on the convention chosen)
- This law is based on the [[#Electric charge|conservation of electric charge]]

### Kirchhoffâs Voltage Law

- aka: **second law**, **loop rule**
- The **voltage drop** is the decrease in electric potential along the path of a current flowing in a circuit
- In one traversal of any closed loop, the sum of the voltage rises equals the sum of the voltage drops.

- given a circuit with a voltage source $V$ and resistors $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n$:
	- $I=\frac{V}{\sum R_i}$ is the current through the circuit
	- $V_0, V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$
	- $I\cdot R_i$ is the voltage drop across the $i$-th resistor
	- $V_i$ is equal to $V_{i-1}$ minus the voltage drop across $R_i$
		- $V_0=V$
		- $V_n=0$

- This law is based on the conservation of energy

# Electromotive force

- A **source** (or **electromotive force** or **emf**) is a device that	transforms some other form of energy into electrical energy
- The potential difference (voltage) between the terminals of a source when no current is flowing is called the **emf** of the source 
	- The emf of a source is determined by the chemical reactions that occur within the source
- The **terminal voltage (difference)** is the potential difference between the terminals of a source
- The **internal resistance** of a source is the resistance that the source itself has to the flow of current
	- Unless stated otherwise, we assume the batteryâs internal resistance is negligible, and the battery voltage given is its terminal voltage
- $V=\mathcal{E}-Ir$ is the terminal voltage of a source
	- $\mathcal{E}$ is the emf of the source (in $\mathsf{V}$)
	- $I$ is the current that flows through the source (in $\mathsf{A}$)
	- $r$ is the internal resistance of the source (in $\mathsf{\Omega}$)
	- When $I=0$ (no current is flowing), $V=\mathcal{E}$ (the terminal voltage equals the emf)


# Electrical Circuits

    - A **branch** represents a single two-terminal element (such as a voltage source or a resistor)

            - dioes

- sources
    - An **ideal independent source** is an active element that provides a specified voltage or current that is completely independent of other circuit elements




- A **short circuit** is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero, so $\displaystyle I=\lim_{R\to 0}\frac{V}{R}=\infty$
- An **open circuit** is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity, so $\displaystyle I=\lim_{R\to \infty}\frac{V}{R}=0$

- A **Galvanic cell** (or **voltaic cell**) is an electrochemical cell that converts chemical energy into electrical energy, consisting of:
	- two **electrodes**: conductors through which electric current enters or leaves the cell
		- **anode** ($-$): the electrode where oxidation occurs (loses electrons)
		- **cathode** ($+$): the electrode where reduction occurs (gains electrons)
		- the part of each electrode outside the solution is called the **terminal** which is used to connect the cell to a circuit
	- An **electrolyte** is a substance that conducts electricity by allowing ions to move and can exist either as a liquid (**wet cell**) or a paste (**dry cell**)
- A **battery** is a collection of electric cells connected together
- The total voltage of a **series** (connected end-to-end positive to negative) connection is the sum of the voltages of the individual cells




> [!EXAMPLE] Example: Bunsen cell (zinc-carbon & dilute sulfuric acid)
> - *Electrodes*:
>   - *Zinc anode*: Zinc metal dissolves into the electrolyte as zinc ions ($\ce{Zn^{2+}}$), leaving behind electrons on the zinc electrode, which becomes negatively charged.
>   - *Carbon cathode*: The sulfuric acid electrolyte pulls electrons from the carbon electrode, making it positively charged.
> - *Electrolyte*: The *dilute sulfuric acid* ($\ce{H2SO4}$) serves as the electrolyte, allowing ions (e.g., $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$) to move between the electrodes while completing the internal charge balance.
> - *Chemical Reaction*:
>   - At the *zinc anode*: Zinc undergoes oxidation ($\ce{Zn -> Zn^{2+} + 2e^-}$), releasing electrons into the electrode and producing zinc ions.
>   - At the *carbon cathode*: Electrons flow from the zinc anode to the carbon cathode through an external circuit, where reduction reactions can take place.
> - Voltage: The zinc electrode becomes negatively charged, and the carbon electrode becomes positively charged, creating a potential difference (voltage) between the two terminals.
> - Current: 
>   - (closed circuit) Electrons flow through the external circuit from the zinc anode to the carbon cathode, creating an electric current.
>  	- (open circuit) When the terminals are not connected, only a small amount of the zinc is dissolved,

# Digital electronics

- transistor
	- A **transistor** is a semiconductor device that can amplify or switch current
		- **BJT** (bipolar junction transistor)
			- The **base** is the control terminal
			- The **collector** is the high-voltage terminal
			- The **emitter** is the low-voltage terminal
			- Type of BJT:
				- **NPN** (negative-positive-negative)
				- **PNP** (positive-negative-positive)
		- **FET** (field-effect transistor) 
- a [[logic gate]] is a device that implements a logic function

## Digital signal processing

- The difference between the original continuous analog signal and its digital approximation is called the **quantization error**
- The **resolution** (or **bit depth**) is the number of bits or values for the voltage of each sample (=measurement)
- The **sampling rate** is the number times per second the original analog voltage is measured ("sampled")
- **ADC** (analog-to-digital converter) is a device that converts a continuous analog signal to a discrete digital signal
- **DAC** (digital-to-analog converter) is a device that converts a digital signal to an analog signal
- bandwidth, Spectral band, frequency band #todo
