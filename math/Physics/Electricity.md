# Electric charge

- Electric charge is **quantized**, that is, exists in discrete quantities which are integer multiples of the **elementary charge** $e=1.6022\times 10 ^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}\approx 1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}$
	- The charge of an electron is $-e$ and the charge of a proton is $+e$
	- The SI unit of charge is the **coulomb** (C)
- **Conservation of charge**: the total charge in an isolated system remains constant
- An object can become charged by:
	- rubbing (friction)
	- conduction (transfer of charge from one charged object to another by touching)
	- induction

	- Given a point $a$ with a higher potential $V_a$ and a point $b$ with a lower potential $V_b$:

			- $\mathrm{PE}_a < \mathrm{PE}_b \implies \Delta \mathrm{PE} < 0$
		- A **positive charge** placed at $a$ has higher potential energy than at $b$, so it will move from $a$ to $b$ (when released) and decrease its potential energy.

- #todo 
	- **electric current** (aka: **conventional current**) is a flow of electric charge
		- electric current from $+$ to $-$ is equivalent to a negative electron flow from $-$ to $+$
		- conventional current combines the effects of electron, ion, proton, and hole flows all into one number.
		- conventional current is not the opposite of electron current
		- Electron current is a subset of conventional current. 
	- A 19th-century convention, still in use, treats any electric current as a flow of positive charge from a region of positive potential to one of negative potential.
		- The real motion, however, in the case of electrons flowing through a metal conductor, is in the opposite direction, from negative to positive.
