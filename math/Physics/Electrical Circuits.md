# Electric charge

- Electric charge is **quantized**, that is, exists in discrete quantities which are integer multiples of the **elementary charge** $e=1.6022\times 10 ^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}\approx 1.6\times 10^{-19}\,\mathsf{C}$
	- The charge of an electron is $-e$ and the charge of a proton is $+e$
	- The SI unit of charge is the **coulomb** (C)
- **Conservation of charge**: the total charge in an isolated system remains constant
- An object can become charged by:
	- rubbing (friction)
	- conduction (transfer of charge from one charged object to another by touching)
	- induction

# Electrical Circuits

- elements of an electric circuit:
    - A **branch** represents a single two-terminal element (such as a voltage source or a resistor)

- A **short circuit** is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero, so $\displaystyle I=\lim_{R\to 0}\frac{V}{R}=\infty$
- An **open circuit** is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity, so $\displaystyle I=\lim_{R\to \infty}\frac{V}{R}=0$



- #todo 
	- **electric current** (aka: **conventional current**) is a flow of electric charge
		- electric current from $+$ to $-$ is equivalent to a negative electron flow from $-$ to $+$
		- conventional current combines the effects of electron, ion, proton, and hole flows all into one number.
		- conventional current is not the opposite of electron current
		- Electron current is a subset of conventional current. 
	- A 19th-century convention, still in use, treats any electric current as a flow of positive charge from a region of positive potential to one of negative potential.
		- The real motion, however, in the case of electrons flowing through a metal conductor, is in the opposite direction, from negative to positive.

- #todo
    - Components of an electrical circuit
        - Voltage source
            - Terminals:
                - Positive voltage terminal (higher voltage)
                - Negative voltage terminal (lower voltage)
    - Passive sign convention (PSC)
        - electric power is positive if it flows out of the circuit into an electrical component
        - electric power negative if it flows into the circuit out of a component
        - Passive components (loads) will have positive power dissipation ($p>0$) and positive resistance ($r>0$)
        - Active components (sources) will have negative power dissipation ($p<0$) and negative resistance ($r<0$)
        - The **conventional current** variable $i$:
            - If $i$ is defined such that positive current enters the device through the positive voltage terminal:
                - $p=vi$ and $r=\frac{v}{i}$
            - If $i$ is defined such that positive current enters the device through the negative voltage terminal:
                - $p=-vi$ and $r=-\frac{v}{i}$

# Electric potential energy

- **Electric potential energy** is the energy stored in a system of charges due to their positions relative to each other
- $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$ is an uniform electric field, 
- $q$ is a tiny positive charge first placed at point $a$ near the positive plate and then released from rest and accelerates toward the negative plate. 
	- $W = Fd = qEd$ is the work done by the electric field $E$ to move a charge $q$ a distance $d$
	- $\Delta \mathrm{PE}=\mathrm{PE}_b-\mathrm{PE}_a=-W$ is the change in electric potential energy when a charge $q$ moves from point $a$ to point $b$

## Electric energy

- Electric energy is the capacity to do work
- $\displaystyle E=\int _{t_0} ^t Pdt=\int _{t_0} ^t VI dt$
    - $E$ is electrical energy (in joules) absorbed or supplied by an element from time $t_0$ to time $t$
    - $P$ is power (in watts)
    - $V$ is voltage (in volts)
    - $I$ is current (in amperes)


# Electric Potential

- **Electric potential** (or simply **potential**) is the electric potential energy per unit charge.
- $\displaystyle V=\frac{\mathrm{PE}_a}{q}$
	- $V$ is the electric potential (in $\mathsf{V}$, volts)
	- $\mathrm{PE}_a$ is the electric potential energy at point $a$ (in $\mathsf{J}$, joules)
	- $q$ is the charge (in $\mathsf{C}$, coulombs)

## Voltage

- **Voltage** (or **(electrical) potential difference**) is the difference in electric potential between two points in a circuit.
	- $\displaystyle V_{ab} = V_a - V_b = \frac{\mathrm{PE}_a-\mathrm{PE}_b}{q}$ is the **voltage** between points $a$ and $b$.
	- We often use ground (0 V) or infinity as a reference point.
	- Voltage is the energy required to move a unit charge from one point to another.
	- The SI unit of voltage is the **volt** (V), defined as $\mathsf{1\ V = 1\ J/C}$.
	- Given a point $a$ with a higher potential $V_a$ and a point $b$ with a lower potential $V_b$:
		- A **negative charge** placed at $b$ has higher potential energy than at $a$, so it will move from $b$ to $a$ (when released) and decrease its potential energy.
			- $\mathrm{PE}_a < \mathrm{PE}_b \implies \Delta \mathrm{PE} < 0$
		- A **positive charge** placed at $a$ has higher potential energy than at $b$, so it will move from $a$ to $b$ (when released) and decrease its potential energy.
			- $\mathrm{PE}_a > \mathrm{PE}_b \implies \Delta \mathrm{PE} > 0$
		- In both cases, $\Delta V = V_a - V_b > 0$.


# Electric power

- Electric power is the rate of transfer of electrical energy within a circuit
- $P=\frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{dE}{dq}\frac{dq}{dt}=VI$
    - $E$ is electrical energy (in joules)
    - $t$ is time (in seconds)
    - $P$ is power (in watts)
    - $V$ is voltage (in volts)
    - $I$ is current (in amperes)
    - $q$ is charge (in coulombs)


# Electric current

- Electric current is the flow of electric charge
- The SI unit of current is the **ampere** (A), which is defined as 1 C/s
- A current is **positive** if it flows from the positive terminal of a voltage source to the negative terminal

# Kirchhoff's Laws

- Kirchhoffâs Current Law 
    - The sum of the currents flowing into any node is equal to the sum of the currents flowing out
- Kirchhoffâs Voltage Law
    - In one traversal of any closed loop, the sum of the voltage rises equals the sum of the voltage drops.
