- Wave length $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$
    - $v$ is the speed of the wave
    - $f$ is the frequency of the wave
    - $\lambda$ is the wave length

### Sine Wave

A **sine wave** (or **sinusoid**, symbol: âˆ¿) is any function of the form $f(t)=A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$, where:
	- $A$ is the amplitude
	- $\omega$ is the angular frequency (in $\mathsf{rad/s}$)
	- $\phi$ is the phase shift (which moves the wave left or right on the time axis)
	- $t$ is the time
	- $\sin$ is the sine function
