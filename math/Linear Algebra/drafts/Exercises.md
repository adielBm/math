- find a basis for $\text{Sp}(K)\cap\text{Sp}(L)$
# Matrices

- find a $m\times n$ matrix $A$, such that $\text{null}(A)=\text{Sp}(\{ v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{m} \})$ 
	- **2019a**85q8b, **2018b**86q5b
- number of eigenvalues - **2023b82**q3b1

- Given a matrix $A$ in which some entries are dependent in varible $a$. 
	- **Q**: find the $a$ values such that $A$ is diagonalizable. 
		 - Find the eigenvalues of $A$ using characteristic polynomial.
		 - Find the values of $a$, for which the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue $\lambda_{i}$ is equal to its geometric multiplicity which is $\dim{(\lambda_{i}I-A)}=n-\text{rank}(\lambda_{i}I-A)$.
	 - **Q:** prove that for each $a$, the matrix $A$ is diagonalizable.
		 - Find the eigenvalues of $A$ using characteristic polynomial. by (11.3.6) if $A$ has $n$ **distinct** eigenvalues, then $A$ diagonalizable
	- **Q:** find $\det(A)$
		- see q11.4.7
 
# Vector Spaces 

## dimension 

- finding dimension 
	- of $V=\text{Sp}(K)$
		- met. 1:
			- put $K$'s vectors as row in A
			- $\text{rank}(\text{REF}(A))=\dim{V}$
