- (d1.12) $F$ is called an **antiderivative** of $f$ on an interval $I$, if $\forall x\in I,\, F'(x)=f(x)$
	- The process of finding an antiderivative $F$ from its derivative $f=F'$ is called **[[integration]]** (or **antidifferentiation**)
- (d2.1) The set of all antiderivatives called the **indefinite integral** of the $f$ with respect to $x$ and denote by: 
	- $\displaystyle\int f(x) dx= \{ F(x):F'(x)=f(x),x \in I \}$
		- The symbol $\int$ is an **integral sign**
		- The function $f$ is the **integrand** of the integral
		- $x$ is the **variable of integration**
- (2.2) if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ then $\int f(x) \, dx=\{ G:G=F+c,c \in \mathbb{R} \}$. 
	- (or shortly, $F'=f\implies \int f(x) \, dx=F(x)+C$)
