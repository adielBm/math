- (d3.24) Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence of real numbers and let $n_{1}<n_{2}<\dots<n_{k}<\dots$ be a strictly increasing sequence of real numbers. Then the sequence $(a_{n_{k}})$ given by $(a_{n_{1}},a_{n_{2}},\dots,a_{n_{k}},\dots)$ is called **subsequence of** $(a_{n})$
- if $(a_{n_{k}})$ and $(a_{m_{k}})$ are subsequece of $(a_{n})$, we say that they **cover** $(a_{n})$ if $\set{n_{k}}\cup\set{m_{k}}=\mathbb{N}$

# Theorems

- every subsequence of a bounded sequence is bounded
- (3.25) if $(a_{n})$ converges to $x$ (or tends to $\pm \infty$) then every subsequence of $(a_{n})$ is also converges to $x$ (or $\pm \infty$)
- (3.32) (BW) **Bolzanoâ€“Weierstrass theorem** - Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence
- (3.33) Every sequence has a *convergent* (or *tends to infinity*) subsequence
- (q3.48) **Monotone Subsequence Theorem** - Every sequence has a monotonic subsequence
