- (d2.15) A sequence $(a_{n})$ is bounded if $\exists{M>0}:\forall{n}, |a_{n}|<M$
- (2.16) Every convergent sequence is bounded

- **Arithmetic**
	- (q2.19a,b,f) The sum/difference/product of two bounded sequences is a sequence bounded
	- (q2.19d) The sum of bounded sequence and unbounded sequence and is unbounded sequence
