- An **interior point** of an interval $I$ is an element of $I$ which is not an endpoint of $I$


Definition:

If I is an interval and also $x\in I$
- We say that x is a right endpoint of I if x=max I ; 
- We say that x is a left endpoint of I if x=min I ; 
- And in any other case we say that x is an interior point of I.

If I is an interval and $x\in I$:
- x is called the right endpoint of I if x=max I;
- x is called the left endpoint of I if x=min I;
- In any other case, x is referred to as an interior point of I.

# Partition

- (d1.1) A **partition** of an interval $[a,b]$ is a set $P=\set{x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2},\dots, x_n}$ where $a=x_{0} < x_{1} < x_{2} < \dots < x_{n}=b$
	- Every interval of the form $[x_{i}, x_{i} + 1]$ is referred to as a **subinterval** of the partition $x$.
	- A **refinement** of the partition $P$ of the given interval $[a, b]$ is a partition $Q$ that contains all the points of $P$ and possibly some other points as well. (the partition $Q$ is said to be "finer" than $P$)
		- Given two partitions, $P$ and $Q$, one can always form their **common refinement**, denoted $P∨Q$, which consists of all the points of $P$ and $Q$, in increasing order
