# Basic Theorems

- (6.9) **Compactness Theorem** - Let $K$ be an infinite set of [[Logic/CS Logic (20466)/Predicate Logic/Syntax#Sentence|sentences]]. If every finite subset of $K$ is [[Logic/CS Logic (20466)/Predicate Logic/Semantic#Satisfiable Set|satisfiable]], then $K$ is satisfiable
- (6.10) **Löwenheim–Skolem theorem** - if a [[Logic/CS Logic (20466)/Predicate Logic/Semantic#Theory|theory]] $K$ [[Logic/CS Logic (20466)/Predicate Logic/Semantic#Model of Set|has an infinite model]], then it has also countable model
	- (6.10') if a theory $K$ has an infinite model, then for every infinite cardinality $\alpha$, the theory has model with cardinality $\alpha$
- (6.11a)
- (6.11b)
- (6.12) for every theory $K$, either
	- there exists $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $T\vdash \psi_{n}$, where $\psi_{n}$ is a sentence that says "there at most $n$ obejct, such that every model of T has at most $n$ objects". or,
	- T has models in every infinite cardinalities
