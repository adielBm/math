- An **atomic formula** (aka: **atom**, **prime formula**) is a formula with no deeper propositional structure, that is, a formula that contains no logical connectives or equivalently a formula that has no strict subformulas. Atoms are thus the simplest well-formed formulas of the logic. Compound formulas are formed by combining the atomic formulas using the logical connectives.
	- The precise form of atomic formulas depends on the logic under consideration; 
		- In propositional logic, a propositional variable is often more briefly referred to as an "atomic formula", but, more precisely, a propositional variable is not an atomic formula but a formal expression that denotes an atomic formula. 
		- In predicate logic, the atoms are predicate symbols together with their arguments, each argument being a term. 
		- In model theory, atomic formulas are merely strings of symbols with a given signature, which may or may not be satisfiable with respect to a given model


- well-formed formula, (WFF, formula)
	- A **well-formed formula** is any atomic formula, or any formula that can be built up from atomic formulas by means of operator symbols according to the rules of the grammar.


- $\Sigma$ **tautologically implies** $\uptau$ (written $\Sigma\models\uptau$) iff every truth assignment for the sentence symbols in $\Sigma$ and $\uptau$ that satisfies every member of $\Sigma$ also satisfies $\uptau$
- A set $\Sigma$ of expressions is **decidable** iff there exists an effective procedure that, given an expression $α$, will decide whether or not $α ∈ \Sigma$
- A set $A$ of expressions is **semidecidable** iff there exists an effective procedure that, given any expression $ε$, produces the answer “yes” iff $ε ∈ A$. 


- **Propositional Variables** (aka: propositional symbols, sentential symbols, sentential variables) are #todo 

- Compactness theorem #todo
